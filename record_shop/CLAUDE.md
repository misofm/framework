# Agent guidance

## Project structure

- `sources/` — production Sui Move modules.
- `tests/` — Move unit and end-to-end tests.
- `fixtures/privacy/` — standalone packages that must fail to compile.
- `scripts/check-witness-privacy.sh` — validates the expected privacy failures.

## Project rules

- Use Move 2024 syntax and composable public functions.
- Import modules, functions, and types with `use`; never write fully qualified
  `address::module::member` paths inline, and use the imported module name in
  test attributes (`location = pressing`, not `location = record::pressing`).
- Identify event types through phantom type parameters when the type is known
  at emission. Do not duplicate those identities as `TypeName`, strings, or bytes
  in event payloads. Keep runtime type data only when it cannot be represented
  by static type parameters; a module-fixed type needs no payload field.
- Preserve `record_shop::witness::Witness` as drop-only with a
  `public(package)` constructor used only by the purchase path.
- Keep Listings derived directly from Pressings with no singleton Record Shop.
- Keep `purchase` composable: it returns the Record and forwards all payment to
  the tracks' royalty pools with `release_license::forward`.
- Run `make verify` after changes.
- When available, use the official Sui documentation MCP server at
  `https://sui.mcp.kapa.ai` for current API verification.
